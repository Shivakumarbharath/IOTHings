* A socket is characterised by
    1. Domain  2. Type 3. Protocol

* Each socket has set of addresses that they can use. the format of addresses are specified by the protocol family (depends on domain)

* A domain specify the network medium that the socket communication uses
* The most commonly used socket domain is AF_INET
* AF_INET - uses IP protocol and machines are addressed using IP-Addresses

* Some of the commonly used PORT NO: (PORT NO < 1024 are system ports)
    8080 - Apache, 21 - FTP

Socket types :
--------------
Sockets are classified based on the service it provides on IP as,
1. Stream Socket(TCP) 2. Datagram Socket(UDP)

Stream Sockets are reliable using TCP - data sent is guarenteed, not lost
Datagram Sockets are not reliable using UDP - best effort service

* Stream Socket - SOCK_STREAM
* Datagram Socket - SOCK_DGRAM

* Stream Socket - connection establishment -> Data Transfer
* Datagram Socket - No connection Establishment
