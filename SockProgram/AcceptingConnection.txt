* Once a server program has created and named a socket, it can wait for connections to be made to the socket by the clients by using the accept system call

#include <sys/socket.h>

int accept (int socket, struct sockaddr *address, size_t *address_len) ;

** Very Important
The accept function creates a new socket to communicate with the client and returns its descriptor
The new socket has the same type as the server listen Socket

** Server listens to client using listen socket
** Upon accept - creates a new socket for each client and frees up the listen socket.
