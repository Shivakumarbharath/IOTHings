* the socket gets created by socket() function call
* to make the socket available for use by other processes a server program needs to give the socket a name - this is done by bind()


AF_UNIX socket - associated with file system path
AF_INET - associated with the IP Address and Port Number


The Bind system call assigns the address in the parameter to the unnamed socket with the descriptor.

#include <sys/socket.h>
int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, size_t address_len)


socket - File descriptor of socket
*address - IP address
address_len - IP Address length

Return value : 0 on successful bind or else returns -1 on error
